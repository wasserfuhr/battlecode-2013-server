 * An exception used to kill robot threads when their robot dies in the game.  In other words, when a robot
 * dies, a RobotDeathException is thrown in the robot's thread, and it propagates all the way up to RobotRunnable,
 * ending the robot's thread.  This must be an unchecked exception, since it could be thrown anywhere in the player's code.
